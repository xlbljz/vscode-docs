    If you don't have a Copilot subscription yet, you'll be signed up for the [Copilot Free plan](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-copilot-as-an-individual-subscriber/managing-copilot-free/about-github-copilot-free).

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Telemetry in your free version of GitHub Copilot is currently enabled. By default, code suggestions that match public code, including code references in the VS Code and <github.com> experience, are allowed. You can opt out of telemetry data collection by disabling telemetry in VS Code by setting `setting(telemetry.telemetryLevel)` to `off`, or you can adjust both telemetry and code suggestion settings in [Copilot Settings](https://github.com/settings/copilot).

1. You can now start using Copilot in VS Code. Learn the basics with the [Copilot Quickstart](/docs/copilot/getting-started.md).

## Use a different GitHub account with Copilot

If your Copilot subscription is associated with another GitHub account, sign out of your GitHub account in VS Code, and sign in with another account.

1. Select the **Accounts** menu in the Activity Bar, and then select **Sign out** for the account you're currently signed in with for Copilot.
